			<p>
			Watercolor painting is a method of painting with water mixed with transparent pigments. 
			It is called watercolor for short. Because the color is transparent, covering one layer 
			with another can produce special effects. However, too much mixed color or covering will
			make the color dirty and the water will dry quickly. Therefore, watercolor painting is not
			suitable for making large works, and it is suitable for making fresh and bright small paintings such as landscapes.
